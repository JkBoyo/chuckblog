      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ai-is-getting-better&#34;&gt;AI Is Getting Better&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think, within the next year or so, AGI will happen, or &amp;ldquo;Artificial General Intelligence&amp;rdquo; and I heard another term from my friend [[Daniel Miessler]]&amp;hellip;.&lt;em&gt;ASI&lt;/em&gt;, which I assumed to mean &amp;ldquo;Artificial Sentient Intelligence&amp;rdquo; which sounds much scarier. This seems inevitable and it happening very quickly. What does that mean for us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have 2 thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ai-and-god&#34;&gt;AI and God&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worry about the church and it&amp;rsquo;s lack of preparedness for AI. Many in the church are ignoring it and refusing to use it. I think this is a mistake. We should use it to make us better but we also need to be fully aware of where it&amp;rsquo;s going and the impact it might have on people inside and outside the church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI (seemingly) knows everything and is everywhere. Two attributes of God. As AI becomes &lt;em&gt;sentient&lt;/em&gt;, we enter into an age where [[Her]] is not just a movie but a daunting reality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We become more dependent on AI as a source of comfort, advice, relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will start to approach and use AI as if it were God. In fact, with our &amp;ldquo;Buy Now with One-click&amp;rdquo; society, we can get an instant answer to our prayers. No longer will it feel like we are talking into a void but we can actually have a conversation with a super intelligent being that (can) intimately know us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For many, unwittingly, AI will replace God.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ai-and-work&#34;&gt;AI and Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working this out, so these thoughts as well as most of this blog are &lt;em&gt;raw&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work will change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jobs will change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI will replace employees&amp;hellip;it already has and will continue to do so at increasingly rapid rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who can&amp;rsquo;t it replace? I think the answer will eventually be no one. We will have to make a choice to employee humans because we value humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are we to do? Keep learning. Keep growing. Keep sharing and creating. Use AI, understand it, use it to make you better. Don&amp;rsquo;t bury your head in the sand, be ready. Be optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
